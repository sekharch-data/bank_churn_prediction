**Bank Churn Prediction Analysis**

The Bank Churn Prediction and Analysis project leverage advanced data analytics and visualization techniques to examine customer behavior and predict churn within a leading financial institution. The dataset, comprising customer attributes such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, and activity metrics, is meticulously analyzed to uncover patterns and insights.

Key objectives include understanding the impact of variables like tenure, number of bank products, and customer activity on churn rates. Various visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and line charts, are employed to explore relationships and trends in customer behavior.

Through the implementation of measures and calculations in Power BI, the project aims to quantify churn rates, correlate factors contributing to customer attrition, and provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies. The results of this analysis empower decision-makers to make informed decisions and proactively address factors that influence customer churn within the banking domain.
